 - Machine learning is about training learning a model and AI is about learning how to learn
 - Typically in ML we use 70% of the dataset to train the model and 30% to test its accuracy
 - ETL is more suitable for smaller data whereas ELT is more suitable for big data
 - Scalable data storage can be either vertical or horizontal
