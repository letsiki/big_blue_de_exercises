Docker Compose Exercise: Configurable Web Server

📌 What the App Does
Starts a lightweight HTTP server using Python.

Reads the contents of config/config.txt at runtime.

When you visit the container in your browser, it displays the content of the file.

Both the internal port (the app’s port) and external port (what you visit in the browser) are fully configurable using environment variables.

📌 Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will learn how to:
✅ Use Docker and Docker Compose to run a simple web server.
✅ Pass configuration values into the container using environment variables.
✅ Use a bind-mounted file (config.txt) to modify the application’s behavior without rebuilding the image.
✅ Understand the difference between the host port and container port in Docker networking.

📌 Steps to Complete
1️⃣ Create a .env file to set the HOST_PORT and CONTAINER_PORT environment variables.
2️⃣ Edit the Dockerfile following the instructions inside it.3️⃣ Edit the docker-compose.yaml following the instructions inside it.

📌 How to Use It
🚀 Start the App

`docker compose up --build`

🌍 Visit the App
Open your browser to: 👉 http://<server_ip>:8080 (or whichever port is set in .env under HOST_PORT).

You should see the message from config/config.txt.

📌 Try Changing the Config File
Modify the contents of config/config.txt using a text editor:

`nano config/config.txt`

Then refresh your browser to see the updated message!
