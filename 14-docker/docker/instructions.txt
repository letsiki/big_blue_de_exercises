Inside the VM
Create a a directory ~/scraper
Create a a directory ~/csv

From the Host
Copy all files into the newly created scraper directory of the VM

from vm ~
docker build -t scraper:latest ./scraper
docker run -d -v ./csv:/app/csv scraper:latest

This should generate a csv file inside the ~/csv folder of the VM every minute.
To verify it works, wait until a csv file appear in the scv directory, remove it with 'rm', and wait for it to appear again.
